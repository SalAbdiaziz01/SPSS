1. Variable metadata

Q1: Using the questionnaire-codebook document, determine which SPSS variable name represents the data collected from question: “My tweet has been published in what time zone?”

- When importing the dataset from excel the "Sent+" and "Sent-" variable name contain an illegal character (which is "+" and "-"). So SPSS change it to "Sent" and "Sent_A" which is not usefull. To combat this issue we can rename "Sent+" to "SentPos" and "Sent-" to "SentNeg"

Q4: What is the level of measurement of the variable SentPos?

-The level of measurement is negative

Q5: How many distinct values are associated with the variable SentNeg?

-When analyzing "SentNeg", the minium value= -1 & maximum value= -5 meaning that it cotains 5=distinct values
