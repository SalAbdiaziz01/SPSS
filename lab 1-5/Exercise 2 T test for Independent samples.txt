Q10: Which one is the independent variable? 
-totsas
Q11: Can the group variances be considered equal (according to Leveneâ€™s test)? 
-The value of p>0.05 (0.078) meaning there is no significant difference in the result, meaning these group variances are to be considered equal according to Levene's test.
Q12: What is the t-score for this difference (to 3 dp)?
-(Equal variances assumed) t=4.836
Q13: What is the p-value and is this significant?
-The value of p=.078 and there is no significant differences since p>.05
Q14: What is the effect size (to 2 dp)?
-using Eta square=t^2/(t^2 +(N1+N2 -2)) value of eta square=.008746
Q15: According to the guidelines described in the lecture slides (originally proposed by Cohen, 1988), is this a small, moderate or large effect?
-The effect on result is greater than .06 but less than .14 meaning the effect is moderate
