Q1: Is the relationship roughly linear?
- No the relationship is not linear (very roughly)
Q2: Is the correlation positive or negative
- There is no correlation at all (slightly negative)
Q3: Is this direction consistent with the hypothesis posited at the start of this exercise
-No at all
Q4: What are the id numbers of the two most extreme cases where the respondents reported not feeling sleepy at all, yet were still highly dissatisfied with the amount of sleep they were achieving?
-200,298
Q5: What is the Pearson correlation coefficient of correlation between totsas and satsleep (to 3
dp)?
- -0.476
Q6: Is this statistically significant to at least the 0.05 level? 
- value of sig (2-tailed) is <.001 meaning there is a significant difference in the result as it is less than 0.05
Q7: According to the guide described in the lecture, is this a small, medium or large correlation? 
-When using Eta squared = t2/ (t2+ N â€“ 1) the value of eta squared is 0.633 meaning there is a large effect
Q8: If people were perfectly accurate/truthful judges of their own weight, what would you expect the correlation between these two measures of weight to be?
-inconsistent
Q9: Compute the actual correlation coefficient and, from this, derive the proportion of variance
shared between the two variables. What is this value?
-0.165
